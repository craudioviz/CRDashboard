## Emotional State Transitions

Each avatar supports dynamic mood shifts:

- `visionary`: energized → focused → inspired → neutral
- `analyst`: focused → neutral → energized → inspired
- `creator`: inspired → neutral → energized → focused

These transitions are triggered by UX events like friction, praise, audit pass, or burnout.
